## ✨ Projects

Digital Elevator Controller (Logisim, Sequential Circuits & FSM)
Designed and implemented a digital elevator control system using D Flip-Flops, comparators, priority encoders, and logic gates. Simulated elevator movement across four floors with up, down, idle, and stop signals. Displayed current floor using a 7-segment display. Applied finite state machine (FSM) theory to a practical sequential circuit system.

InDev Club Website (HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript)
Contributed to the official website of the InDev student club, showcasing events, announcements, and resources. Focused on creating a professional, responsive, and user-friendly interface with modern design practices.

Mathematical Functions Library in C
Built a modular C static library (AlgorithmProject) with a header file and multiple mathematical functions (basic, intermediate, advanced). Implemented dynamic memory handling for matrix operations (including inverse calculation).

Array Utilities Library in C
Developed a reusable library with functions for sorting, searching, analysis, and manipulation of arrays. Included optimized algorithms for both beginners and advanced use cases.

Word Processing System with Linked Lists & Stacks (C)
Implemented a text-processing program handling synonyms, antonyms, sorting, and word operations using data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.

Traffic Simulation with Queues (C)
Modeled a one-way road intersection with queue-based simulation. Implemented traffic rules, signal timing, and vehicle flow management.

Coffee Shop Website (HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript)
Built a professional multi-page website (“The Gentle Bean”) with reservation system, menu, and social media integration. Designed with a unique, elegant, responsive UI.

E-Commerce Fashion Website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Created a stylish Amazon-style e-commerce platform with product display, cart management, and checkout system. Designed custom UI with category-based navigation and hero sections.
